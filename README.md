"# arduboy-for-pc" 

Testing zone for cross compiling arduboy sketches as PC executables.

May at some point allow some/most Arduboy games to be cross-compiled as PC executables.  
SDL is used as the back-end, so we should be able to cross compile for Win, Mac, Lnx.

Requires SDL 1.2 development libraries.
Only tested with Windows and MinGW so far.
